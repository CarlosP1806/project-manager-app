# Project Manager Application

## üìÉ Project Description
This application allows registered users to manage their programming projects via cards that show tasks to be done. It encourages teamwork by letting the project owner invite new members to collaborate in the team, either by adding new tasks or commenting existing ones.

I was motivated to build this learning project to further expand my knowledge of the MERN stack. I explored important React aspects, such as managing state with the context API, and separating large scale projects into small components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

First, the user must create an account. Then a dashboard will show the user's current active projects, as well as the invitations to collaborate on a team. Create a new project by clicking in the corresponding button in the dashboard, and provide basic details to begin. 

The project view has two parts: overview and tasks. The overview section shows the project information and the members of the team. It also shows project settings only to the owner, that allow updating the project details.

In the project tasks section, all the pending work will be shown, grouped in different categories based on completion status. The color code indicates the type of task to be done, such as bugs or features. Click on each task to display a modal showing more information and comments. Below there are some screenshots showing how the project looks like:
